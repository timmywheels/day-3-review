Goals: My primary goal as a developer is to change the world using technology. I'm fascinated by being able to build things, and learning to program has tremendously helped me to change the way that I think and problem solve. Even though I've only scratched the surface, learning how to code has been one of the hardest things I've ever done. It's simulataneously the most gratifying and frustrating thing I've experienced. I'm an extremely competitive person, and programming has quickly become my number one competitor.

Another one of my goals with becoming a developer is to have complete freedome. I want the ability to be able to work from just about anywhere that there's an internet connection. The thought of that is definitely what motivates me.

Even though I've been with CareerDevs for only about 2 weeks at this point, this is already a life-changing experience for me. I want to surround myself with likeminded people with similar goals, and this has definitely been the place for that. I can't wait for the journey that lies aheads.
