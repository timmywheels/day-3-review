Takeaways: So far, the main takeaways I've gotten from CareerDevs are...

1. Be resourceful. Google is a developers best friend, and chances are, someone has already encountered the same problem you're facing. You can almost always find the answer to your problem by doing a quick search.

2. Work together. Two minds are greater than one and that is something that is really proven true when you're trying to figur out something that you're stuck on. Just by asking your peers a few questions, you can hone in on the answer that much faster. This was super helpful to me on one of our first projects, the UNIX tutorial. My entire table ended up getting stuck on an error that was being thrown when we were trying to compile our package running the 'make' command. Just by putting our heads together we were all able to contribute and resolve the issue at hand.

3. Repitition is key. It's pretty difficult to remember everything that's being thrown at us on the first time around. Whether it's the UNIX tutorial, or the Git Immersion tutorial, or even FreeCodeCamp.org. There's nothing wrong with going back through any of these again until you really grasp the concepts. In fact, I've already gone through theses tutorials multiple times in order for things to start to stick. The key is to just keep at it.

4. Embrace the chaos. A lot of these concepts are foreign to most of us, and for the most part it's (literally) as if we're trying to learn another language. All the new terminology and nuances of each language and program can definitely become overwhelming, but that's the beauty of it all. If learning how to program was easy, then everyone would do it.
